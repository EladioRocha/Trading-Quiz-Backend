  "content": "<p>There are a variety of different ways that you can trade forex, but they all work the same way: by simultaneously buying one currency while selling another. Traditionally, a lot of forex transactions have been made via a forex broker, but with the rise of online trading you can take advantage of forex price movements using derivatives like CFD trading</p> <p>CFDs are leveraged products, which enable you to open a position for a just a fraction of the full value of the trade. Unlike non-leveraged products, you donâ€™t take ownership of the asset, but take a position on whether you think the market will rise or fall in value.</p> <p>Although leveraged products can magnify your profits, they can also magnify losses if the market moves against you.</p>",
