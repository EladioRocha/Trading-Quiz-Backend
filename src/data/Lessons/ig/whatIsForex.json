  "title": "What is Forex?",
  "content": "<p>Forex refers to the marketplace where various currencies and currency derivatives are traded, as well as to the currencies and currency derivatives traded there. Forex is a portmanteau of &quot;foreign exchange.&quot; The forex market is the largest, most liquid market in the world by trading volume, with trillions of dollars changing hands every day. It has no centralized location, rather the forex market is an electronic network of banks, brokers, institutions, and individual traders (mostly trading through brokers or banks).</p><p>Many entities, from financial institutions to individual investors, have currency needs, and may also speculate on the direction of the movement of a particular pair of currencies. They post their orders to buy and sell currencies on the network so they can interact with other currency orders from other parties.</p><p>The forex market is open 24 hours a day, five days a week, except for holidays. The forex market is open on many holidays on which stock markets are closed, though trading volume may be lower.</p>",
