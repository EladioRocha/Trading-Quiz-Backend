  "title": "Why Do Companies Sell Stock?",
  "content": "<p>When learning how to value a company, it helps to understand the nature of a business and the stock market. Almost every large corporation started as a small, mom-and-pop operation and, through growth, became a financial giant.</p><p>Consider Walmart, Amazon, and McDonald's. Walmart was originally a single-store business in Arkansas. Amazon.com began as an online bookseller in a garage. McDonald's was once a small restaurant that no one outside of San Bernardino, California, had ever heard of. How did these small companies grow from tiny, hometown enterprises to three of the largest businesses in the American economy? They raised capital by selling stocks.</p><p>As a company grows, it continues to face the hurdle of raising enough money to fund ongoing expansion. Owners generally have two options to overcome this: They can either borrow the money from a bank or venture capitalist or they can sell part of the business to investors and use the money to fund growth. Companies often take out a bank loan because it's typically easy to acquire and very useful, up to a point.</p><p>Banks won't always lend money to companies, and over-eager managers may try to borrow too much, which adds a lot of debt to the company balance sheet and hurts its performance metrics. Factors such as these often provoke smaller, growing businesses to issue stock. In exchange for giving up a tiny fraction of ownership control, they receive cash to expand the business.</p><p>Going public provides a company with money that doesnâ€™t have to be paid back. It also gives the business managers and owners a new tool. Instead of paying cash for certain transactions, such as the acquisition of another company or business line, they can use their own stock.</p>",
