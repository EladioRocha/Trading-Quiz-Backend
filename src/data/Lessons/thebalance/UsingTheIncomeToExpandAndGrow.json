  "content": "<p>Their business performs even better in the new branches. The two new stores make around $800,000 a year in profit each, while the old store still makes the same $500,000. Between the three stores, ABC now makes an annual profit of $2.1 million.</p><p>Although they no longer have the flexibility of a small business or the freedom to simply close shop, their company is now valued at $51 million. You would reach this by multiplying their new earnings of $2.1 million per year by 20 (the average furniture stock multiple mentioned earlier) and add the company's latest book value of $9 million since each store has a book value of $3 million. The couple’s 60% stake now has a total worth of $30.6 million.</p><p>With this example, it’s easy to see how small businesses seem to explode in value when they go public. The original owners of the company, in a sense, become wealthier overnight. Before, the amount they could take out of the business was limited to the profit that was generated. Now, the owners can sell their shares in the company at any time, raising cash quickly.</p><p>This process forms the basis of Wall Street. The stock market functions as a large auction where ownership in companies just like ABC Furniture is sold to the highest bidder each day. Because of human nature and the emotions of fear and greed, a company can sell for far more or for far less than its intrinsic value. A good investor learns to identify those companies currently selling below their true worth so that they can buy as many shares as possible.</p>",
