  "content": "<p>The young couple, now in their 30s, must decide how much of the company they are willing to sell. Right now, they own 100% of the business. The more company shares they sell, the more cash they’ll raise, but they must keep in mind that by selling more, they’ll be giving up a larger part of their ownership. As the company grows, that ownership will be worth more, so a wise entrepreneur would not sell more than he or she had to.</p><p>After discussing it, the couple decides to keep 60% of the company and sell the other 40% to the public as stock. When you do the math, this means that they will keep $7.8 million worth of the business (60% of the $13 million value). Because they own a majority of the stock, greater than 50%, they will still be in control of the store.</p><p>The other 40% of the stock that they want to sell to the public has a value of $5.2 million. The underwriter finds investors who want to buy the stock and gives a check for $5.2 million to the couple.</p><p>Although they own less of the company, the owners' stake will hopefully grow faster now that they have the means to expand rapidly. Using the money from their public offering, ABC Furniture successfully opens two new stores and has $1.2 million in cash left over, since they raised $5.2 million but only used $4 million.</p>",
