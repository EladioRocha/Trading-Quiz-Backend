  "content": "<p>The workings of the stock market can be confusing. Some people believe investing is a form of gambling and feel that, if you invest, you will likely end up losing your money.</p><p>These fears can stem from the personal experiences of family members and friends who suffered similar fates or lived through the Great Depression. These feelings are understandable but aren't grounded in facts. Someone who believes in this line of thinking may not have an in-depth understanding of the stock market, why it exists, and how it works.</p><p>Other people believe that they should invest for the long run but don’t know where to begin. Before learning about how the stock market works, they look at investing like some sort of magic that only a few people know how to use. More often than not, they leave their financial decisions up to professionals and cannot tell you why they own a particular stock or mutual fund.</p><p>This investment style could be called blind faith, or perhaps it's limited to a sentiment such as, 'This stock is going up—we should buy it.' Though it may not seem so on the surface, this group is in far more danger than the first. They tend to invest by following the masses and then wonder why they only achieve mediocre, or, in some cases, devastating results.</p><p>Upon learning a few techniques, the average investor can evaluate the balance sheet of a company and, following a few relatively simple calculations, arrive at their own interpretation of the real value of a company and its stock.</p><p>This allows an investor to look at a stock and know that it is worth, for instance, $40 per share. This gives each investor the freedom to determine when the market has undervalued stocks, increasing their long-term returns substantially, or overvalued it, making it a poor investment candidate.</p>",
