  "content": "<p>Ten years later, the business has grown rapidly. The couple has managed to pay off the company’s debt and have profits of more than $500,000 per year. Convinced that ABC Furniture could do as well in several larger neighboring cities, the couple decides they want to open two new branches.</p><p>They research their options and find out that they need over $4 million to expand. Not wanting to borrow money and make debt and interest payments again, they decide to raise funds by offering equity to potential shareholders, so they sell stock in their company.</p><p>The company approaches an underwriter for the stock offering, such as Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan, who digs into their financial statements and determines the value of the business. As mentioned before, ABC Furniture earns $500,000 after-tax profit each year. It also has a book value of $3 million, which means the value of the land, building, inventory, and other assets, after covering the company’s debt. The underwriter researches and discovers the average furniture stock trades on the market at 20 times its company's earnings.</p><p>What does this mean? Simply stated, you would multiply the company's earnings of $500,000 by 20. In ABC’s case, this results in a market value estimation of $10 million. If you add in the company's book value, you arrive at $13 million. This means, in the underwriter’s opinion, that ABC Furniture has a total value of $13 million.</p>",
